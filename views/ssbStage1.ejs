                                approach towards each task and you will hit the target. This is the summary of the three
                                techniques Psychology, GTO and Interview.</p>
                            <p>The screening is a test which is used to sort list the candidates who are suitable for
                                Stage II of testing, it is an elimination procedure. Once you are Screened-In then you
                                will be staying for next four days at the Centre. Before the screening test starts you
                                will be given the temporary Chest Numbers which will be your identity thereafter and
                                while performing the test ,address the candidate with their Chest Number only, the Chest
                                Numbers are given to you to make all of you feel equal.</P>
                            <h4>Series of test in the Screening:</h4>
                            <p>a) Officer Intelligence rating Test.</p>

                                fresher this will be against you, if you fall in the fresher group. Fresher concentrate
                                on the test, give your 100% and display your confidence.</p>

                            <h4>Officer Intelligence Rating Test</h4>
                            <p>This is the most important test and the marks obtained in this are valid even for Stage

                                start assessing you in this test for your positive approach towards any situation in the
                                form of picture perception by writing a short story on the situation. If your approach
                                found to be logical and practical in this test then you are considered to be evaluated
                                in narration of the story.</p>
                            <p>In narration the assessors access your communication skill and the level of confidence
                                while speaking. If found suited in this test you are considered to be evaluated in the

                                coordination and cooperation in the team. Be an active and constructive participant and
                                value other's thought and logics.</p>
                            <p><b>Consistent performance in the screening is very important to get screen in.</b></p>
                            <p><b>Note -</b> Those who succeed will face the Stage II and others are routed back on the
                                same day, however by no means getting screened out reflects your potential, even
                                recommended candidates get screened out. So, friends don't get disappointed, analyse
                                your performance as explained above, improve yourself and come back with a bang and get
                                selected. Our Defence forces are waiting for you.</p>
