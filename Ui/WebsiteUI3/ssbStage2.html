                            <h3>Stage Two of SSB starts with Psychological test.</h3>
                            <p>It is a great opportunity for the successful candidates to prove their potential,
                                capability and display their confidence for the next four days in the three techniques
                                Psychology test, GTO and Interview. In this stage PIQ plays a very important role. So
                                concentrate and remember your PIQ in detail.</p>
                            <p>One very important thing to note in this stage that all the assessors of the three
                                techniques are psychologist and evaluating the candidate's psychology by three different
                                methodologies and conclude the candidate personality fit for the defence force. So
                                consistent performance in all three techniques is must. So it is very important to
                                understand the concept of Psychology, GTO and Interview in detail as below.</p>
                            <h4><b><u>Psychological Tests:</u></b></h4>
                            <p>This is a very important test conducted with an aim to study the mental functions and
                                behaviours of the candidate with a series of test with different time pressure and
                                evaluate the candidate by his/her answering approach. Candidate has to react to the
                                different condition and situations and capture their logical response in the answer
                                booklet provided by the centre. Consistent performance is must in these series of test.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is very well possible that of the candidate can be called for the interview just after
                                this test is completed, so be mentally and physically prepared. Accordingly maintain
                                Proper dress code so that you don't come into any unwanted pressure. However proper
                                dress code will give confidence and positive feeling which is very important in these
                                tests.</p>
                            <p>Psychological tests consist of various tests conducted in a sequence and without any
                                break details are below:-</p>
                            <h4><b><u>Thematic Apperception Test</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is the first test in Psychologist Test Series. This test
                                is not the story writing competition but evaluation of your personality. Be practical,
                                logical and organised in your thoughts and present very neatly and clearly. Every Story
                                must have the following points.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>What is the Objective / Aim / Goal / Target of the picture.</li>
                                <li>What is the logical/practical approach to achieve Objective / Aim/ Goal/ Target.
                                </li>
                                <li>How to organise the logical /practical approach to achieve point 1.</li>
                                <li>Result / Outcome / Message</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>You will be shown 12 pictures and for each of the picture you have to write a story in 4
                                Minutes. In this test a set of provocative yet ambiguous pictures are shown to you, as
                                you are required to interpret a story from the picture hence the test is sometimes also
                                called as picture interpretation technique. 11 pictures will be having some theme behind
                                them but the <b>12th</b> will be <b>blank</b>. You have to yourself imagine a picture
                                and write a story on it. The pictures will be shown to you for<b> 30 Seconds and 4
                                    Minutes</b> time will be given to you for writing the story. There will be no time
                                gap between the pictures and as soon as the 30 seconds are over your time for writing
                                the story starts so you must not do any delay.</p>

                                restricted to 15 Seconds so that candidate is not confused with subsequent thoughts and
                                gives his first thought only.</p>

                                ensure that the candidate gives the first reaction which comes to his mind without
                                thinking much over it.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>Group Testing Officer (GTO)</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Group Testing Officer commonly known as GTO is the second assessor out of the three. GTO
                                the second technique in the SSB and a very important test. In this test the candidate
                                has to be mentally and physically alert in the ground for 2 days with the GTO in 9
                                different tasks.</p>

                            <p>Now, let us discuss the 9 GTO's task / games in brief. You can get the detail of each and
                                every task by clicking on the name of that particular task.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>1. Group Discussion</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Group Discussion (GD) is the first test in GTO Tests. It is a friendly and informal
                                opinion on the topics of common / current /social interests but of controversial nature.
                                GD is similar to what you do sitting with your friends in canteen of your school/college
                                or units of your regiment etc. So it is very important to be an active participant and a
                                good listener.</p>
                            <p>Generally there is confusion between Debate and Group Discussion but unlike Debate there
                                is no chair person, you are permitted to say what you like, when you like and as many
                                times you feel like, and No Conclusion is to be reached, there are no restriction except
                                that not more than 1 Person should speak at a time. Speak logical and respect each
                                other's view and moreover behave as a gentleman.</p>
                            <p><b>Group Discussion No.1</b></p>
                            <p>Gentlemen this GD is very important part of the GTO. GTO will start identifying the
                                leaders from the group based on your performance in the group. So try to be cooperative
                                and logical in giving your points.</p>
                            <p>So the group will be given 2 topics out of which the group will have to choose one topic
                                for discussion (your group will be given approx 15-30 Seconds time to discuss and select
                                the topic. Mind it this is also an pre GD from here only you're noticed and evaluated.)
                                Selection of the topic plays a major role here.</p>
                            <p>Once the topic is decided then GTO will Repeat the topic and your group will discuss for
                                approximately 15 Minutes and thereafter GTO will interrupt you saying that "it was a
                                nice discussion" even if your group members were selling their fish in the market.</p>

                            <p><b>Group Discussion No.2</b></p>
                            <p>After the First GD you will be given another topic for Discussion but this time there
                                will be no choice, the topic will be decide by the GTO himself on the basis of
                                performance of your group in the first GD. Again the group will discuss it for approx.
                                15 Minutes as done in the first case.</p>
                            <p>Now he is confirmed with the capability of the group and accordingly selects his priority
                                list of candidates and keep verifying them in next series of test and keep on updating
                                his priority list by changing the position in the group till he conclude his final list.
                            </p>
                            <h4><b><u>2. Group Planning Exercise</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Group Planning Exercise (GPE) or sometimes called as Military Planning Exercise. This is
                                similar to SRT test of psychology. But this task has been designed with 3D model placed
                                on ground, it consists of certain problems which are given to you to react and solve it.
                            </p>
                            <p>Initially the Candidate is required to give his plan of action to solve the given set of
                                problems with help of the group and then discuss within his group and come to a common
                                group solution.</p>
                            <p>So, unlike the Group Discussion where no conclusion was to be reached but in this
                                exercise the candidates have to reach a definite conclusion that is mutually agreed
                                group solution.</p>
                            <p>This exercise is conducted in 5 stages which are as follows.</p>
                            <p><b>Stage 1:</b> In this Stage GTO explains only once various features of the model laying
                                on the ground, he will tell you about the marks, direction, scale and other features of
                                the model like roads (Metallic or non-metallic road), dams, nalas, river, railway lines,
                                police posts, jungle or any other features, doubts if any are to be cleared at the end
                                of this stage. But don't ask stupid doubts, GTO get irritated. Use your common sense and
                                put yourself in this situation in a realistic manner and get the best solution with help
                                of the group. Listen each and every instruction honestly.</p>
                            <p><b>Stage 2:</b>In this stage GTO reads a story connected with the model laying on ground,
                                the story has certain problems in it like a person who is injured or any unsocial
                                element mixing poison in water tank and so on. Doubts are to be cleared at the end of
                                this stage.</p>

                            <p><b>Stage 2:</b>In this stage GTO reads a story connected with the model laying on ground,
                                the story has certain problems in it like a person who is injured or any unsocial
                                element mixing poison in water tank and so on. Doubts are to be cleared at the end of
                                this stage.</p>

                            <p><b>Stage 3:</b> In this stage you will be given the story card (same from which GTO read
                                the story in Stage 2) to read for 5 Minutes and thereafter the card is collected from
                                you, doubts if any are to be cleared at the end.</p>

                            <p><b>Stage 4:</b>After collecting the Story card from you, you will be provided with a
                                sheet of paper and in that sheet of paper you have to write your individual plan /
                                solution in10 Minutes and thereafter the sheet will be taken back from you.</p>

                            <p><b>Stage 5: </b>In the Final Stage the candidates are required to discuss among them self
                                for the group solution for approx. 15 Minutes, And after reaching the group plan /
                                making a group plan.</p>
                            <p>GTO will instruct "Any one of the candidates among the group may stand up and give the
                                group plan or the group has to discuss and nominate any one from the group to give the
                                group plan". So act according to the GTO instruction.</p>
                            <p>The candidate who stands up or nominated by the group must ensure to give the mutually
                                agreed group plan only to the GTO with the help of a pointer.</p>
                            <h4><b><u>3. Progressive Group Task</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Progressive Group Task (PGT) is the first out door task after your GD and GPE. In this
                                test GTO wants to see your approach on the ground in a team. It is just like playing a
                                game / tournament. So be a good team member/ player, keep giving inputs, respect each
                                other ideas and keep motivating your team mates like you do while playing.</p>
                            <p>Progressive Group Task (PGT) is the first of the GTO task in which all GTO Rules apply,
                                this task consists of 4 obstacles in a straight line. It is known as a group task
                                because all of you will be working as a group to achieve a common goal. The task is
                                called progressive because the first obstacle is very simple, the second obstacle is bit
                                difficult, the third obstacle is more difficult and the fourth one is most difficult,
                                this means that the level of difficulty increases with obstacles and hence the name
                                Progressive.</p>
                            <p>In Service Selection Boards there are no natural obstacles like Ditches, Nalas and rivers
                                so what is done is that a set of parallel lines are drawn and the area between them is
                                placed out of bounds for candidates. So these becomes obstacles to you, to help you
                                cross the obstacles certain structures are placed which the candidates can touch, you
                                will be Provided with helping material in form of planks, Ballies and Ropes. You will be
                                also carrying a load with you which is a sensitive black box whom you have to carry
                                carefully.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>4. Snake Race</u></b></h4>
                            <p>In this task the GTO wants to evaluate your approach when you're in josh. The concept
                                remains same as PGT. Snake Race or mostly known as Group Obstacle Race (GOR) is one of
                                the interesting but some time painful tasks in SSB. So plan well in coordination with
                                your team to avoid any short of injury.</p>
                            <p>It is interesting because you have to cheer a lot and you will enjoy as you will compete
                                with other groups and may be painful because your group coordination may fail and result
                                in injury, so be cool an charm take your team member inputs on regular basis to avoid
                                such injuries. Do not bother about the injury as generally it will be some scratch on
                                your knees or elbows however at times this task results in serious injury also, but your
                                aim should be to perform well in the race rather than thinking about those injuries.</p>
                            <p>Your Group have to decide a War Cry (a slogan) which you have to continuously shout to
                                cheer your group.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>5. Lecturette</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Lecturette is one of the most important tests in the GTO Process. Here the candidate gets
                                the chance to display his/ her confidence as an individual.
                                GTO in this test evaluate your knowledge, clarity of your thought, self-confidence to
                                express yourself in front of the group.</p>
                            <p>In this task GTO has a set of Lecturette cards with him. Each card has four topics
                                written on it. Each one of you has to pick up a card and move to some distance and
                                prepare on any 1 topic among the four topics for three minutes and then come in front of
                                the group and deliver the talk for 3 minutes. Selection of the topic plays a major role
                                here.</p>

                            <p>Time - 3 Minutes</p>

                            <p>The candidate wearing the first Chest No. (let's say Chest No. 1) in your group will pick
                                up a card move to some distance and start preparing, after 2.5 minutes GTO will give a
                                single Bell (or any other signal) to tell the candidate that half a minute is still left
                                and as soon as 3 Minutes are over, GTO will give double bell and the Chest No.1 will
                                move to the GTO give him the card, tell him the topic on which he is going to give talk
                                and then come in front of group and start delivering the speech, at the same time the
                                next chest no. Let say Chest No.2 will pick the top most card and move a little distance
                                away and start preparing...</p>


                            <h4><b><u>6. Half Group Task</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Half Group Task (HGT) is another important test in GTO series, in which your complete
                                group will be divided into two half's, the reason behind this division is that as there
                                will be few dominating candidates in your group, who will not allow other to perform due
                                to their nature. So, HGT gives others a chance to showcase their potential with less no.
                                of candidates. Some time the two half might not have equal candidates if you have odd
                                no. of candidates in your group.</p>
                            <p>So here also the concept should remain same as PGT.</p>

                            <p><b>Difference between PGT and HGT :</b> The main difference between PGT and HGT is that
                                in PGT your complete group will perform together(8-10 candidates), while in HGT your
                                group will be divided in two sub groups (4-5 candidates). And another difference is that
                                HGT is not as long as PGT. In PGT you have to cross finish line 4 times while in HGT you
                                have to do that for once only.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>7. Individual Obstacles</u></b></h4>
                            <p>In this test GTO evaluate your planning organising approach, confidence, physical and
                                mental stamina towards each obstacle</p>
                            <p>In this task GTO has a set of Lecturette cards with him. Each card has four topics
                                written on it. Each one of you has to pick up a card and move to some distance and
                                prepare on any 1 topic among the four topics for three minutes and then come in front of
                                the group and deliver the talk for 3 minutes. Selection of the topic plays a major role
                                here.</p>

                            <p>Individual Obstetrical are the set to 10 Obstacles placed in a zigzag manner which each
                                candidate has to do individually as the name suggest. The Time assigned is 3 Minutes.
                                Each obstacle has a Number written against it which denotes the marks that will be
                                awarded for successfully completing the obstacle. For example if there is a number 7
                                written on a certain obstacle then you will be given 7 marks if you completes the
                                obstacle in proper manner.</p>

                            <p><b>Total number of obstacle - 10</b></p>

                            <p><b>Total Marks - 55</b></p>

                            <p><b>Time -3 minutes</b></p>

                            <p>GTO will take you around each and every obstacle and will make you to shout the number
                                written against each obstacle, while he takes you around the obstacle you will find that
                                the obstacles are not arranged in a proper sequence and hence you can start from
                                wherever you fell like may be it is Obstacle No.1 or No.10 and you can finish anywhere
                                you like.</p>

                            <p>But analyse and plan your route in a very effective manner so as you complete the task in
                                the given time of 3 minutes. Always start from simple to toughest so as to boost your
                                confidence as you keep moving..
                                If you gets struck on a particular obstacle just give one more attempt if failed move
                                ahead to complete the remaining task and come back and complete it in the available
                                balance time.</p>

                            <p>In case you have successfully done all the 10 obstacles then you are at the liberty to
                                repeat the obstacles but repetition over an obstacle can be done only once. Let say you
                                completed your Ten obstacle on obstacle No.8 then you can do obstacle 8 once only and
                                come back to do it again only if you completes all the other obstacles. In case if you
                                completed all obstacles then rather than thinking for marks do the repetition of those
                                obstacle which is close to you. If you completed all obstacles successfully then you
                                will be awarded 55 Marks and if you repeated any obstacle then you marks will increase
                                let say you repeated obstacle No.10 and No.5 the you sum will 70(55+10+5=70).</p>

                            <p><b>Procedure</b></p>

                            <p>The candidate bearing first chest no. in your group will be called first and he can stand
                                near to any obstacle from where he wants to start, GTO will instruct him to start by
                                blowing his whistle, after 2.5 minutes GTO will again blow his whistle which is to
                                indicate the Candidate who is currently doing the obstacle that half a minute is still
                                left and the next candidate will stand near to the obstacle from where he wants to start
                                as soon as the full 3 minutes gets over then GTO blows his whistle twice to indicate the
                                first candidate to stop doing the tasks as his time is over and to next candidate that
                                his time starts now. So, there will be no gap between two candidates doing the task. If
                                GTO blows his whistle twice and you are still doing the task then leave the task as it
                                is and move out of ground or as instructed.</p>
                            <h4><b><u>8. Command Task</u></b></h4>
                            <p>In this test the GTO evaluate your individual approach. The logic remains same as PGT,
                                HGT. GTO will test your ideas by putting you in lot of stress, keep trying and keep on
                                giving different ideas. don't take ideas from the subordinate and don't try to give
                                ideas as subordinate.</p>
                            <p>Command Task is another task in GTO series, as the name suggests you will be made
                                commander. Each candidate from your group will in turn be made as a Commander and also
                                as subordinates.</p>
                            <p><b>Time -15 minutes (Generally)</b></p>
                            <p><b>Role as Commander</b></p>
                            <p>You must properly command your subordinates; you should behave as a commander but never
                                do the mistake of thinking your subordinates as your servants. You must logically choose
                                your subordinates and should command them to complete the task, if any of your
                                subordinates says or does anything without your instruction then tell him not to do so,
                                or if they are breaking any rule then ask them to go back to previous point and start
                                again from that point.</p>
                            <p><b>Role as Subordinate:</b> As a subordinate you must not do or say anything unless your
                                commander asks you to say or do anything, you must not take any action on your own as a
                                subordinate.</p>

                            <p><b>Introduction Before CT: </b> Before your Command task starts GTO will take a small
                                interview while proceeding towards your task. So behave in the manner you will be
                                behaving in the interview.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>9.Final Group Task</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Final Group Task (FGT) is the last task as the name suggest in the GTO series but as
                                important as the first one. So your participation and joss should remain as it was in
                                PGT. In this task your complete group of 8-10 candidates will perform together. The
                                structure will be similar to PGT</p>
                            <p>Command Task is another task in GTO series, as the name suggests you will be made
                                commander. Each candidate from your group will in turn be made as a Commander and also
                                as subordinates.</p>
                            <p><b>Time - 15 minutes (Generally)</b></p>

                            <p><b>Difference between PGT and FGT :</b>As far as difference between PGT and FGT is
                                concerned, the only difference is that FGT is small as compared to PGT and hence less
                                time is allocated to FGT.</p>
                            <p>Another difference which you will feel is that in FGT a different energy is flowing among
                                your group, now all members will be more cooperative and helping as compared to when you
                                did PGT.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>INTERVIEW</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Interview is again the individual performance test as it was in psychology. So no
                                external influence is here as in GTO. So these two test Interview and Psychology is
                                totally in the control of candidate and can win the battle if perform his best.</p>
                            <p>Interview is one to one affair between the candidate and the Interviewing Officer (IO)
                                for around 30 to 45 minutes based on his / her PIQ and psychology test copy. Almost all
                                the question will be related to your PIQ only. So PIQ filling is very important Also
                                candidate presentation while entering into the Interview room and his confidence during
                                the interview, his logical approach and honesty plays major role in his/her
                                recommendation.</p>

                            <p>There will be one or two Officer taking your interview in SSB. During your whole
                                interview you will be given a chair to sit but the IO will try to pull you from that
                                chair (not physically but by his questions). Unlike other interviews the seating
                                arrangement will be such that all your body movement and your manners will be seen by
                                the IO.</p>

                            <p>Generally at Service Selection Boards interview is conducted in afternoon and evenings
                                but you might have you interview in morning. So always be mentally active. You must go
                                with a relaxed mind for the interview and you must not be unnecessarily nervous.</p>

                            <p>You will be made to wait in a room which will be having some pictures/photos and
                                magazines before you proceed for your interview, sometimes IO asks you questions related
                                to that room so you must also make yourself familiar with that also.</p>

                            <h4><b><u>CONFERENCE</u></b></h4>
                            <p>Conference is the last test but very important so the candidate must give his/ her best
                                performance. Conference takes place on the 5th Day (not the final day as your final day
                                will be on last day of medicals) of your SSB Interview. In Conference all your assessors
                                like Psychologist, GTO, the Interviewing officer and the President of the Board will sit
                                together, they will be in their service uniform and this is the only time in which you
                                will see all of them together in uniform. They discuss your performance of last 5 days
                                and take a call whether to recommend you for Medicals or not. If some of you on whom the
                                Selectors of the Board might have some doubts, this is the time in which they will clear
                                their doubts.</p>
