                            <p>History of National Defence Academy / Indian Army dates back to ancient India. From the
                                ancient era
                                to the modern age Indian army has evolved through the ages, with the bravery of Indians.
                                History of
                                Indian Army is pregnant with real and true accounts of extraordinary heroism and valour
                                and can be
                                traced back to the ancient periods in India. The earliest mention of Indian Army is
                                found in the
                                ancient texts and scriptures, including the Vedas and the epics Mahabharata and
                                Ramayana. Modern
                                India has witnessed several valorous soldiers who have laid down their lives for their
                                motherland.
                                The names of such warriors have been immortalized in the history of Indian army.</p>
