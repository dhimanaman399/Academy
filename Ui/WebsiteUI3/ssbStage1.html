                                day for those who reports in afternoon around 2.00 PM. This is very important test one
                                small mistake will put the candidate in trouble even for the recommended candidate but
                                don't worry concentrate on your each test and display your confidence with positive
                                approach towards each task and you will hit the target. This is the summary of the three
                                techniques Psychology, GTO and Interview.</p>
                            <p>The screening is a test which is used to sort list the candidates who are suitable for
                                Stage II of testing, it is an elimination procedure. Once you are Screened-In then you
                                will be staying for next four days at the Centre. Before the screening test starts you
                                will be given the temporary Chest Numbers which will be your identity thereafter and
                                while performing the test ,address the candidate with their Chest Number only, the Chest
                                Numbers are given to you to make all of you feel equal.</P>
                            <h4>Series of test in the Screening:</h4>
                            <p>a) Officer Intelligence rating Test.</p>
                            <p>b) Picture perception and Description Test.</p>

                            <h4>Important -</h4>
                            <p>Be cool and charm focus towards the test. Repeaters stop influencing especially to the
                                fresher this will be against you, if you fall in the fresher group. Fresher concentrate
                                on the test, give your 100% and display your confidence.</p>

                            <h4>Officer Intelligence Rating Test</h4>
                            <p>This is the most important test and the marks obtained in this are valid even for Stage
                                II also where you have to verify your Intelligence in all the three technique. This test
                                is aimed to judge the Intelligence of a candidate and if you qualify in this test then
                                only you will be considered for the next series of test in the screening. In this test
                                you will be given Verbal and Non-Verbal test booklets which you have to solve in the
                                given time, you have to solve as many number of question as you can. The number of
                                question are generally 40 and time given to you to solve them is 17 Minutes, however the
                                number of question can go up to 50 in some centres and you will be given some added time
                                in that case. You must have lot of practice for this test as time given to you is very
                                less.</p>
                            <p>There is No Negative Marking in Verbal and Non-Verbal tests so try to solve the maximum
                                possible questions honestly.</p>

                                start assessing you in this test for your positive approach towards any situation in the
                                form of picture perception by writing a short story on the situation. If your approach
                                found to be logical and practical in this test then you are considered to be evaluated
                                in narration of the story.</p>
                            <p>In narration the assessors access your communication skill and the level of confidence
                                while speaking. If found suited in this test you are considered to be evaluated in the
                                group discussion.</p>

                                coordination and cooperation in the team. Be an active and constructive participant and
